SMART PURCHASE SYSTEM

Allows users to easily purchase Aritime, buy Data, burrow Data and Airtime.
An initialize balance of 1,000 is set to be use by the user.
The system prompts a user to either type *555# to continue or type 'stop' to terminate the program.
Any input aside these two commands inputed by the user is rendered an invalid command.

The Borrow feature allows the user to purchase Airtime or Data depending on their choice irrespective of the user balance.
User will be able to check available Balance after each successful transaction.

In a situation where the user wants to purchase either Data or Airtime and the Available balance is not enough for the required transaction,
an error message pops up telling the user Insuficient funds!.

This platform is user friendly, easy to use and open to positive criticism.

Let me know which features you'd want to be implemented in the system.
Your thougts are higly appreciated!
